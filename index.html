		<h2>About Hercules</h2>
		<p>Hercules is the son of Zeus and Hera who was kidnapped by Hades's minions, Pain and Panic as a baby. They then made him drink a potion which was suppose to transform him from a God to a human so that they could kill him. However, Hercules did not drink the entire potion as one drop was left in the bottle. Hercules was then transformed into a mortal with super strengh! He goes through life feeling like he never belongs anywhere until he embarks on a journey to become a real hero.</p>
